# Steganography in Cloud Computing

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Research Question

Which steganography technique is the most useful and efficient in reducing attacks on cloud system security?


## Research Objectives 

To conduct a thorough literature review to identify potential research gaps in research revolving around the use of steganography techniques to improve cloud security 
To determine the weaknesses in the security of cloud computing systems 
To identify the current trends in steganography techniques that can be used to enhance cloud security 
To perform a comparative analysis of steganography techniques in order to ascertain which technique is the most effective in preventing attacks on cloud systems 



## Steganography Techniques

 In this study, four methods have been implemented to assess the efficiency of the steganography technique with respect to data security. They are as follows: 
> Least Significant Bit (LSB)

> Spread Spectrum Technique

> Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

> Pixel Value Differencing (PVD
